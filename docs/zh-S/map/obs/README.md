## 簡介 Intro

<Foldable>

**地圖組嘅單一目的係做一張精準嘅現場地圖**。 一張準確嘅地圖,可以方便所有的參與者、前線、記者互相溝通,同埋係一個冇大台帶領嘅情況下各自做正確嘅決定。

We are a single-purpose group, and the focus is on an accurate, real-time map.  This facilitates communication by protestors, front-line, and reporters, and help them make correct decisions individually.

基本運作流程 (以下用612大概兩點半左右嘅情況做例子):

1. 現場各位觀察者 先在 紙張空白地圖 上面 mark 低自己區域嘅人流部署

![annotated map](/image/map/721-map-blank-full.png)

2. 現場各位觀察者 行去上到網嘅地方,影低手上的地圖 send上 tg group

![annotated map](/image/map/612-1430-map-scribble.png)

1. 小編根據現場觀察者嘅資料,同埋其他哨兵channel, 整合為一張地圖

4. 小編 up 到 103.hk/map
5. 大概每15分鐘重複一次

## 運作流程 Procedures

<!-- 有啲人面對面比較容易講,同埋可以分發文具同埋空白地圖。希望可以係 星期六 或 星期日早上,聚一聚講解當日流程。

I hope to be able to meet all of you to distribute printed maps and stationary for you, and explain some of the following in person.

I hope to order some embroidered caps and T-shirts for you, so you can more easily get help to do what you do.  They will not arrive this weekend. -->

[Text for now, graphics addition to come.]

### Before

1.  Bring pen (ideally with different colours), a clipboard (so that you can write on the maps), powerbank, water, tape (for posters), umbrella and necessary equipment to protect yourself onsite.  See also [here](./gear/).

2. Collect maps and posters (for location and time, see group pinned post; expect delays in travel!).  Download a copy of the images needed on your phone, incl. the legend.

### Initial setup

3. **Initial setup**
   1. go to your chosen zone
      * If you are in zones C (Central) or A (Admiralty), stay in your zone.  There is expected to be police blockages preventing passage from Wan Chai to Admiralty.
   2. locate barricades / supply stations / first aid stations on maps. Photograph and post onto group.
      * barricades: X
      * Supply stations: S inside two circles
      * First aid: fat cross inside two circles
   3. Put up posters to publicize link
   4. tell first aiders/ supplies team that we have this real-time map.  Ask if they have special requests.  Give [@hongkong103](https://t.me/hongkong103) as a point of contact.

### Ongoing

4. **Ongoing during the march** 
   1. walk around (try to find a vantage point e.g., bridge) 
   2. keep updating the map as needed.  This includes
      * crowd density (**Y** = normal loose crowd, **YY** = arm distance btw ppl (e.g., normal march), **YYY** = shoulder-packed)
        * Use B / BB / BBB for pro-regime forces
      * police density (**P** = some police, **PP** = concentrated force)
      * If people are moving, use arrows to indicate speed.  
        * Single arrowhead for slow / congested flow,
        * Double arrowhead for normal walking speed,
        * Triple arrowhead for running speed (should be rare)
        * Resonance arrow for bi-directional flow
      * draw triangles together with annotations for other observations
    3. Urgent/ spontaneous events (eg teargas/ black flag): message immediately with this template:
        * Time | District | Map coordinates | Location (Better with street name) | Event
            * e.g. 14:00 | 金鐘 | J10 | 夏慤道-添華道 | 出黑旗
        * Send pics / vids if you think it is important
    4. take picture of the map and send every 15 mins.  You will probably need to walk to less crowded places to have internet access.  
        * You may not need to send picture of map if not much is happening in the previous while: just use the same template as above to report isolated updates.

Drink water, eat, go to bathroom, and rest in a mall when you can.  Use good taste and judgment.

You may be able to recruit temporary replacements on-site, when you need to take break, or when you need to go but this will leave an empty zone.

Walking around with a clipboard, you will stand out and people will be staring.  **Smile, be your helpful charming enthusiastic selves, explain what you are doing.**  

You may also be confronted.  **Smile, be your helpful charming enthusiastic selves, explain what you are doing.**  Show that you are an info service and stay neutral in your emotions.  We need you to do what you are doing.  

Please stay safe.  Observe from safe locations.  The map is not as important as you are.

(Ask in the tg group if I am missing something)

<!-- ## 通信層面

We will communicate mostly through the closed telegram group.  From there you have my phone number for urgent text/calls. -->

<!-- ## 負責區域

I propose we (you) pick a zone for patrolling.  I further propose, when possible, we have a "floater".  Please coordinate yourselves in the group.
 -->

## 傳遞資訊

You can relay information back in one of three ways:

1. **take a picture of your annotated map**.  Most useful, esp if irregular shapes are involved (e.g., crowd)
2. **Send a message**.  When things are calm, and you only need to update minor details (e.g., crowd density).  Please note 
   1. the event,
   2. the locality (street/ building) as well as 
   3. the grid coordinates.  A complete example: "About 10 ppl moving up to the side of Bank of America, P30").
3. **Send a message (as above), with a picture/video**.  This is useful for rapid, important developments (clashes, barricades, tear gas) that *cannot* wait for the 15 min updates. -->
