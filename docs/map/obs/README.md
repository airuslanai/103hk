# Info for observers

Most of you will know me in real life, but for what we do, who I am is inconsequential.  To the public please refer to me as Zi Jau 之柔.

## Meet-up

I hope to be able to meet all of you to distribute printed maps and stationary for you, and explain some of the following in person.

I hope to order some embroidered caps and T-shirts for you, so you can more easily get help to do what you do.  They will not arrive this weekend.

## Setup

The following shows the information flow:

[INSERT IMAGE.  Observers -> ]

I hope we can provide updates at regular 15 minutes intervals.  If things are moving quickly then we try to keep pace.

## Communication channels

We will communicate mostly through the closed telegram group here.

My tg is *hongkong103*.  You will have my phone number for urgent text/calls when we meet.

## Area and actions

I propose we (you) distribute yourselves into 10x10 areas for patrolling.  I estimate that you will be able to cover this distance in 5 minutes, and so you will be able to walk out-in-out in 15 minutes cycles.  We end *out* because you probably need to be somewhat away from the crowd to have reception.

I further propose, when possible, we have a "floater".

Refrain from being "too involved".  We need you to do what you are doing.  Please stay safe.  If you are confronted, explain if it is reasonable.  Get to safe locations.  The map is not as important as you are.

## Relaying information

You can relay information back in one of three ways:

1. **take a picture of your annotated map**.  Most useful, esp if irregular shapes are involved (e.g., crowd)
2. **Send a message**.  When things are calm, and you only need to update minor details (e.g., crowd density).  Please note 
   1. the event,
   2. the locality (street/ building) as well as 
   3. the grid coordinates.  A complete example: "About 10 ppl moving up to the side of Bank of America, P30").
3. **Send a message (as above), with a picture/video**.  This is useful for rapid, important developments (clashes, barricades, tear gas) that *cannot* wait for the 15 min updates.
