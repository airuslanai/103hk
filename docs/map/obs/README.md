# 地圖組資訊 Info for observers

**地圖組嘅單一目的係做一張精準嘅現場地圖**。 一張準確嘅地圖,可以方便所有的參與者、前線、記者互相溝通,同埋係一個冇大台帶領嘅情況下各自做正確嘅決定。

基本運作流程 (以下用612大概兩點半左右嘅情況做例子):

1. 現場各位觀察者 先在 紙張空白地圖 上面 mark 低自己區域嘅人流部署

2. 現場各位觀察者 行去上到網嘅地方,影低手上的地圖 send上 tg group

1. 小編根據現場觀察者嘅資料,同埋其他哨兵channel, 整合為一張地圖

4. 小編 up 到 103.hk/map
5. 大概每15分鐘重複一次

## (旅行之前嘅)茶會

有啲人面對面比較容易講,同埋可以分發文具同埋空白地圖。希望可以係 星期六 或 星期日早上,聚一聚講解當日流程。

I hope to be able to meet all of you to distribute printed maps and stationary for you, and explain some of the following in person.

I hope to order some embroidered caps and T-shirts for you, so you can more easily get help to do what you do.  They will not arrive this weekend.

## 通信層面

We will communicate mostly through the closed telegram group here.

My tg is [@hongkong103](https://t.me/hongkong103).  You will have my phone number for urgent text/calls when we meet.

## 負責區域

I propose we (you) distribute yourselves into 10x10 areas for patrolling.  I estimate that you will be able to cover this distance in 5 minutes, and so you will be able to walk out-in-out in 15 minutes cycles.  We end *out* because you probably need to be somewhat away from the crowd to have reception.

I further propose, when possible, we have a "floater".

Refrain from being "too involved".  We need you to do what you are doing.  Please stay safe.  If you are confronted, explain if it is reasonable.  Get to safe locations.  The map is not as important as you are.

## 傳遞資訊

You can relay information back in one of three ways:

1. **take a picture of your annotated map**.  Most useful, esp if irregular shapes are involved (e.g., crowd)
2. **Send a message**.  When things are calm, and you only need to update minor details (e.g., crowd density).  Please note 
   1. the event,
   2. the locality (street/ building) as well as 
   3. the grid coordinates.  A complete example: "About 10 ppl moving up to the side of Bank of America, P30").
3. **Send a message (as above), with a picture/video**.  This is useful for rapid, important developments (clashes, barricades, tear gas) that *cannot* wait for the 15 min updates.
