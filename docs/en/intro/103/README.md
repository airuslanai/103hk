# Why "103.hk"?

Different languages count with different units.  English uses

* "ten" - 10
* "hundred" - 100
* "thousand" - 1,000

...and have no words for 10,000 ("ten" "thousand").  Chinese have an additional unit for 10,000 (萬; (canto) maan6).

On 9 June 2019 1,030,000 people --- 103 萬 --- unified in a peaceful march against the Extradition Bill.  This would, to everyone's surprise, be surpassed the very next week by another march a week later.

103 symbolizes an awakening of our collective political consciousness, and the beginning of the struggle between the People of Hong Kong and a government that responds only to Beijing.
