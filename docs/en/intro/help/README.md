# Help needed

## IT

1. **Frontend developer**.  This is a static site built on Vuepress, repo'ed on Github and deployed to Netlify.  Some specific features I have in mind are:
  * some way of pulling data from an AirTable database at build time (probably a Netlify function)
  * a component that pulls from a Google Sheet (through tabletop.JS) into an Element UI table, which is then amenable to filtering / sorting.  This will allow easy updating (by others) in some aspects.
  * your-suggestions-here?

2. **adviser**.  I'm pretty sure this is not built right nor deployed right.  My known-unknowns is:
   1. how best to deal with images?
   2. how to hook this to something like Forestry so non-tech editors can also contribute?
   3. is the Netlify-Cloudflare thing an OK setup?

## General

* **Manager** for a language / section, and keeping it in-sync with the other sections.  At the moment the site is all me and I'm already overwhelmed!

## Language

1. **translator-writer-manager**.  My hope is that we go beyond translating the text, into translating the issue for readers of the language.  Many countries go through / went through a democratic process like Hong Kong currently: Koreans probably see in us the 1980s or 2016, Taiwanese sees Sunflower, and I hope we can bring these out.  For now, I hope we can build a base for:
  * **English <-> Chinese** (formal, for both HK and Taiwanese readers), and
  * **Zh-Traditional <-> Zh-Simplified**.  The latter speaking to mainland readers.
  
2. **Editors**.  My writing is terrible, and I still can't conjugate verbs.

## Pictures

1. **designer**.  With my skills (or the lack thereof), the site is going to be what it is :(  Hope someone can think deeply and, based on the elements of the site, create template / style guides / composable elements (AI preferably, or PS) for images that is flexible enough for yourself and other illustrators to build infographics / imagery upon.
