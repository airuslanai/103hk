## Map

On 8.31 we will start monitoring and updating the map from 2 pm.  We update the map every 15 min, more frequently when urgent events are occurring.  However, we evaluate the sources before manually painting the maps, so there exists an unavoidable lag of 3-5 minutes.  The maps are also posted as Telegram messages on the channel [@RealTimeMapHK](https://t.me/RealTimeMapHK).

There are now groups that provide fully automated maps, which complements our approach.  You can find some links here:

* [HKMap.live](https://hkmap.live/)
* [(source?) custom Google Map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1oirckYcAXB-6S2W-oMDN6uKSd8s4sy5l)

With respect to our work, you can direct your suggestions to [@hongkong103](https://t.me/hongkong103).

<!-- ::: warning Sources

We have a small group of runners providing eyes on the ground, and integrate streams of information from various public Telegram groups and live broadcast.

::: tip Usage

Wifi access is poor in crowds, and not everyone can download the latest map (about 1 Mb compressed).  **We suggest using AirDrop once you succeeded in downloading our hi-res image**.  AirDrop uses Bluetooth instead of Wifi and can be an effective way to ripple information.  A timestamp is present in each version of the map for comparison.
