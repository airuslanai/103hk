## Intro

<!-- <Foldable> -->

The mapping team is a single-purpose group, focussed on providing an accurate, real-time map.  This facilitates communication by protestors in various roles and reporters.  We hope to help them accurate assess the situation in order to make informed decisions.

We formed as a response to the HKPF's tactic of bottling civilians and subsequent indiscrimate violence, most prominently displayed in 7.14 siege of Shatin.

We have no expertise and have never done this before.  We learn as we go.  Our reflections can be found [here](../refl/).

::: warning Recruiting

We can't do every event because there's only a few of us.  If you are serious about helping, please write us.

<!-- 

基本運作流程 (以下用612大概兩點半左右嘅情況做例子):

1. 現場各位觀察者 先在 紙張空白地圖 上面 mark 低自己區域嘅人流部署

![annotated map](/image/map/721-map-blank-full.png)

2. 現場各位觀察者 行去上到網嘅地方,影低手上的地圖 send上 tg group

![annotated map](/image/map/612-1430-map-scribble.png)

1. 小編根據現場觀察者嘅資料,同埋其他哨兵channel, 整合為一張地圖

![full map](/image/map/612-1430-map-zh.png)

4. 小編 up 到 103.hk/map
5. 大概每15分鐘重複一次 -->

## Procedures

<!-- 有啲人面對面比較容易講,同埋可以分發文具同埋空白地圖。希望可以係 星期六 或 星期日早上,聚一聚講解當日流程。

I hope to be able to meet all of you to distribute printed maps and stationary for you, and explain some of the following in person.

I hope to order some embroidered caps and T-shirts for you, so you can more easily get help to do what you do.  They will not arrive this weekend. -->

Our team is organized into two main groups, the *Runners*, and the *Control Room*.  Their roles are as follows:

* **Runners**: the runners team serves as our eyes, and use a number of methods to relay on-the-ground observations precisely and concisely to the Control Room.
* **Control Room**: there are two roles in the control room, the **Integrators** and the **Mapper**:
  * **Integrators**: the integrators funnel different streams of information from diverse formats (*e.g.,* runners, Telegram channels, live broadcasts) into an unified format in a single location
  * **Mapper**: the mapper draws the map (duh!) and pushes it to the consumers (through 103.hk, and various Telegram channels)

::: tip 

We detest police brutality, but we also refrain from using dehumanizing (*e.g.,* "dogs") and antagonistic language (*e.g.,* "sentries", "war room").

The ideal operation can be summarized in the following graphic:

### Info For Runners

#### Preparations

1. Bring:
    * **print-outs of areas you expect to be**,
    * water-based markers (ideally with different colours),
    * plastic protectors for A4-sized paper,
    * a clipboard,
    * phone,
    * powerbank, 
    * water & nourishment, 
    * umbrella, and 
    * necessary equipment to protect yourself onsite

2. Digital: download a copy of the images needed on your phone, incl. the legend.  Some apps to markup images (*e.g.,* iMarkup on Android).

### Initial setup

**Initial setup (t-30 min)**
1. go to your chosen zone
   <!-- * If you are in zones C (Central) or A (Admiralty), stay in your zone.  There is expected to be police blockages preventing passage from Wan Chai to Admiralty. -->
2. locate barricades / supply stations / first aid stations on maps.  Memorize the legend.
   * police barricades: X
   * Supply stations: S inside two circles
   * First aid: fat cross inside two circles
   * rest stops: droplet inside two circles
3. Put up posters to publicize link (or attach one to your backpack)
4. tell first aiders/ supplies team that we have this real-time map.  Ask if they have special requests.  Give [@hongkong103](https://t.me/hongkong103) as a point of contact.

### Ongoing

**Ongoing during protests** 

Walk around (try to find a vantage point e.g., bridge).  Stay safe.  Report back in one of the two ways:

1. keep updating the map as needed.  This includes
   * crowd density (**Y** = normal loose crowd, **YY** = arm distance btw ppl (e.g., normal march), **YYY** = shoulder-packed)
     * Use B / BB / BBB for pro-regime paramilitary
   * police density (**P** = some police, **PP** = concentrated force)
   * If people are moving, use arrows to indicate speed.  
     * Single arrowhead -> for slow / congested flow,
     * Double arrowhead ->> for normal walking speed,
     * Triple arrowhead ->>> for running speed (this should be rare)
     * Resonance arrows <->> for bi-directional flow
   * draw triangles together with annotations for other observations
2. Message with this template if possible, only the bolded items if you must.
   *Time | District | Map coordinates | **Location** | **Event**
   * e.g. 14:00 | 金鐘 | J10 | 夏慤道-添華道 | 出黑旗
   * **cross streets OR number+street**.  No exceptions!
   * Use / if | is not available on your keyboard
   * omit time if you must
   * Send pics / vids if you think it is important, and it is possible to take a picture without endangering yourself

::: tip Why?

Information in this format can directly be pasted into our event table, and be distributed to other groups "as is".  Otherwise the Integrators (who are usually overwhelmed) will need to reconstitute some additional info before forwarding.

:::

::: danger

If the info is urgent, *e.g.,* tear gas / violence, indicate this so the Control Room pushes the info immediately.  For these, if you have no data, use text messages.

:::

If possible, take picture of the map and send every 15 mins.  This is the best way for us to know what to remove.  You will probably need to walk to less crowded places to have internet access.  You may not need to send picture of map if not much is happening in the previous while: just use the same template as above to report isolated updates.

Periodically check the latest map, and let the Control Room know if items are out-of-date.  This is the only way we know how to remove items.

Drink water, eat, go to bathroom, and rest in a mall when you can.  Use good taste and judgment.

<!-- You may be able to recruit temporary replacements on-site, when you need to take break, or when you need to go but this will leave an empty zone. -->

Walking around with a clipboard, you will stand out and people will be staring.  **Smile, be your helpful charming enthusiastic selves, explain what you are doing.**  

Our runners have been confronted and stalked, by protestors and plain-clothes police alike.  **Smile, be your helpful charming enthusiastic selves, explain what you are doing.**  Show that you are an info service and stay neutral in your emotions.  Direct / divert their aggression to the webmaster at 103.hk [@hongkong103](https://t.me/hongkong103).

Please stay safe.  Observe from safe locations.  The map is not as important as you are.

Ask if the instructions are unclear.

<!-- ## 通信層面

We will communicate mostly through the closed telegram group.  From there you have my phone number for urgent text/calls. -->

<!-- ## 負責區域

I propose we (you) pick a zone for patrolling.  I further propose, when possible, we have a "floater".  Please coordinate yourselves in the group.
 -->
<!-- 

## 傳遞資訊

You can relay information back in one of three ways:

1. **take a picture of your annotated map**.  Most useful, esp if irregular shapes are involved (e.g., crowd)
2. **Send a message**.  When things are calm, and you only need to update minor details (e.g., crowd density).  Please note 
   1. the event,
   2. the locality (street/ building) as well as 
   3. the grid coordinates.  A complete example: "About 10 ppl moving up to the side of Bank of America, P30").
3. **Send a message (as above), with a picture/video**.  This is useful for rapid, important developments (clashes, barricades, tear gas) that *cannot* wait for the 15 min updates. -->
